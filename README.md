# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model Explained

This repository contains a detailed explanation to the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. It is separated in three Jupyter notebooks:

- **Assumptions**: a introduction to the model, listing the assumptions related to the underlying asset, the market and the option itself.
- **Formula**: a dive into the mathematics and intuition behind the formula.
- **Example**: a guide on how to build a Black-Scholes option pricing function in Python with real-world data.

This project was also published as a three-part story on my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@andrejin.nagano), please feel free to check out my other projects there.
